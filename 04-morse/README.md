# Neo Sees The Code

*"What are you trying to tell me? That I can dodge bullets?"*
*"No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to."*

This is it. Neo finally sees the Matrix - not as reality, but as pure code. The transmission from the machines isn't noise anymore, it's a language. Green characters cascade down like rain, each one carrying meaning.

When Neo could finally read the Matrix code, he became The One. The question is: can you?
