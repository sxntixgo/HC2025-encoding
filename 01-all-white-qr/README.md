# White Rabbit

Follow the white rabbit, Neo. But sometimes what you seek is hidden in plain sight - or rather, hidden in plain white.

You've intercepted a transmission from the resistance. It appears to be a QR code, but something isn't quite right. Your phone's camera can't seem to read it, yet you know the code contains vital information.

The white rabbit is there. You just need to see it differently.
