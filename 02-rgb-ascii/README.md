# Kung Fu

*"I know Kung Fu."*
*"Show me."*

The Nebuchadnezzar's systems have intercepted an encrypted data stream from the Matrix. The signal appears as a dark image with subtle green undertones - classic Matrix rain aesthetics. Intelligence suggests the machines are hiding messages within the very fabric of their visual displays.

Trinity believes the secret lies in how colors are constructed. Every pixel tells a story if you know how to read it.
